Image Search App – Powered by Pexels

Overview

The Image Search App is a web application that allows users to search for high-quality, royalty-free images using the Pexels API. Built with modern web technologies, this project showcases my skills in front-end development, API integration, and responsive design. It was developed as part of my transition to a web developer career, demonstrating my ability to create functional and user-friendly applications.

Features

Search Functionality: Users can enter a query to search for images, with results fetched dynamically from the Pexels API.
Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap and custom CSS for a seamless experience across devices.
Load More Pagination: Users can load additional images with a "Load More" button, enhancing user experience.
Image Zoom: Clicking an image displays its original size in a full-screen overlay with a semi-transparent background.
Modern Styling: Uses Tailwind-inspired design principles and a clean, centered layout with a background image.

Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Framework: Bootstrap 5.3.3 for responsive layout
API: Pexels API for image search and retrieval
Styling: Custom CSS with flexbox for layout and transitions for interactivity
Tools: Git, GitHub for version control

Installation

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-search-app.git


Navigate to the Project Directory:cd image-search-app


Open index.html:
Open index.html in a browser to run the app locally. No server setup is required as it uses client-side JavaScript and the Pexels API.


Obtain a Pexels API Key (optional):
The app includes a sample API key, but for production, get your own key from Pexels API.
Replace API_KEY in app.js with your key.



Usage

Open the app in a browser.
Enter a search query (e.g., "nature") in the input field and click "Search."
Browse the displayed images, styled in a responsive grid.
Click an image to view its original size in a full-screen overlay; click again to close.
Use the "Load More" button to fetch additional images for the same query.

File Structure

index.html: Main HTML file with the app's structure, including header, search form, results, and footer.
style.css: Custom styles for layout, typography, and responsive design.
app.js: JavaScript logic for API calls, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
img/background-wallpaper.jpg: Background image for the app.

Future Improvements

Add error handling for invalid queries or API failures.
Implement a loading spinner during API requests.
Add category filters (e.g., nature, technology) for refined searches.
Optimize performance with debouncing for search input.
